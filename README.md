# Machine-Learning-Metabolic-Syndrome

Machine learning in the context of healthcare is thought to grow to USD 67.4 billion industry by 2027, through the application of revolutionizing clinical decisions and making diagnosis through the use of models and artificial intelligence: with many start-ups entering and exploring this space currently through various software solutions. Too explore the possibilities of this growing industry we set out to explore and compare various machine learning models both (1) supervised models, such as Na√Øve Bayes and logistic regression against (2) unsupervised models such as k-means clustering and principal component analysis with k-means clustering applied as a form of dimension reduction. Through a search of the literature we were unable to find any previous studies which compared and contrasted supervised learning against unsupervised in the context of metabolic syndrome, though similar studies have been applied in the context of diabetes with mixed results. A major limitation in our comparison is that by employing certain assumptions in our unsupervised learning algorithm we resulted in a loss of non-clinical binary features, thus reducing our ability to compare our models. The objective of this study was to find a model with both high accuracy and sensitivity and compare the models against one another. We tend to found that overall accuracy of 80% was common amongst all our machine learning models, both supervised and unsupervised and suggests the predictive power of machine learning in the context of healthcare. Furthermore, through fine tunning our models through the application of assumption testing we where able to produce a model with almost 85% sensitivity, an important indicator of success used in the application of healthcare, without further compromising accuracy and specificity. It was observed that the payoff in improvement of our indicators tend to dimmish as we applied more data scientific methodologies to improve our models and meet as many assumptions as possible, with unpredictable changes such as improving and worsening some key indicators. Overall, this study found that in the application of machine learning is somewhat promising in the application of diagnosing metabolic syndrome and suggests the possibility of one day being incorporated into healthcare given the sheer amount of future investment in this space.
