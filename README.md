# Machine-Learning-Metabolic-Syndrome

Machine learning in the context of healthcare is thought to grow to USD 67.4 billion industry by 2027, through the application of revolutionizing clinical decisions and making diagnosis through the use of models and artificial intelligence: with many start-ups entering and exploring this space currently through various software solutions. Too explore the possibilities of this growing industry we set out to explore and compare various machine learning models both (1) supervised models, such as Na√Øve Bayes and logistic regression against (2) unsupervised models such as k-means clustering and principal component analysis with k-means clustering applied.
